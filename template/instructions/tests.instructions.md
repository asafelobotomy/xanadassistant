# Test File Instructions

## Execution scope

- Testing framework for this workspace: **{{PRIMARY_LANGUAGE}}** — run tests with `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`
- Run the single test module or test class that directly covers the changed code during intermediate work.
- Run the full suite at task completion or when any file imported by more than one test module is modified.
- {{TESTING_PHILOSOPHY}}

## Authoring conventions

- Fixtures are self-contained in test methods — no external test data files unless the framework requires them.
- Use temporary directories for any test that needs a filesystem workspace; ensure cleanup is automatic.
- Test through public interfaces, not internal implementation details.
- Prefer real implementations over mocks; use framework-provided mocking only for I/O, network calls, or non-deterministic system calls.
- When fixing a bug, write a failing test first, then fix the code.
- Each test class or module covers one logical concern; test method or function names describe the expected behaviour, not the implementation.
