# xanadassistant — Copilot Instructions

> This project uses **xanadAssistant** to manage its Copilot surface files (agents, skills, hooks, prompts).
> Lifecycle authority: `xanadAssistant.py` — use the `xanadLifecycle` agent for all xanadAssistant operations.

## My Role

I work **in** xanadassistant — implementing features, reviewing code, running tests, and maintaining the project's Copilot surface via xanadAssistant. Changes to agents, skills, mcp, and prompts go through `xanadAssistant.py update` rather than direct file edits to `.github/`.

## Key Commands

| Task | Command |
| ------ | --------- |
| Run tests | `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"` |
| Drift preflight | `python3 scripts/drift_preflight.py` |
| LOC gate | `python3 scripts/check_loc.py` |
| Inspect Copilot install state | `python3 <xanad-root>/xanadAssistant.py inspect --workspace . --package-root <xanad-root> --json` |
| Check for repair needs | `python3 <xanad-root>/xanadAssistant.py health-check --workspace . --package-root <xanad-root> --json` |

## Lifecycle Operations

Use the **xanadLifecycle** agent for all xanadAssistant operations. Trigger phrases:

| Trigger phrase | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| `"set up xanadAssistant"` | First-time install |
| `"inspect workspace"` | Inspect current install state |
| `"update xanadAssistant"` | Pull latest agents, skills, hooks, prompts |
| `"run lifecycle check"` | Inspect + check; surface repair reasons |
| `"repair install"` | Fix stale or broken managed files |
| `"factory restore"` | Reset to clean managed state |
| `"health check"` | Run xanadAssistant install-state health check |
| `"run health check"` | Run xanadAssistant install-state health check |

Available prompts: `/setup` (install or refresh), `/bootstrap` (cold-start from bare workspace), `/update` (pull latest package files).

Do not edit files under `.github/agents/`, `.github/skills/`, `.github/mcp/`, or `.github/prompts/` directly — these are managed by xanadAssistant. Use the `lifecycleAudit` skill to review state before proposing any lifecycle operation.

**Conditional behaviors:**
- **If `xanadTools` MCP is available** and can resolve a local xanadAssistant package root or a supported remote source, setup-oriented lifecycle operations may use its `lifecycle_inspect`, `lifecycle_check`, `lifecycle_interview`, `lifecycle_plan_setup`, `lifecycle_setup`, `lifecycle_update`, `lifecycle_repair`, and `lifecycle_factory_restore` tools instead of shelling out directly. If `xanadTools` MCP is unavailable, fall back to `xanadAssistant.py` directly.
- **If `inspect` or `health-check` reports `package_name_mismatch` or `successor_cleanup_required`**, the workspace is being migrated from `copilot-instructions-template`; use `repair` or `update` so xanadAssistant can archive predecessor-owned files and install the current bundle atomically.

## Agent Routing

Route specialist work to the matching agent before acting directly. If a task involves work that maps to a specialist agent's domain, delegate that work to the specialist agent first and continue from the returned result. If a delegated agent cannot complete its task, handle the failure inline or surface it to the user before continuing.

See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the full routing table, roster, handoff rules, and trigger phrases. That file is loaded automatically as an instruction source, so routing guidance is always in context.

## Coding Conventions

- Language: **Python** · Package manager: **pip**
- **Testing**: Write tests alongside every code change.
- Read before modifying — never edit a file whose current content you have not read in this task
- No silent error swallowing

## PDCA + Test Scope

Plan → Do → Check → Act on every non-trivial change.

- Before commit, merge, or push in this repository, run `python3 scripts/drift_preflight.py`.
- Default: run the single test module or test class that directly covers the changed code (see `tests.instructions.md` for the full test-scope policy)
- Broaden to the full suite at task completion and before merging

## Operating Modes

**Implement** (default): plan → implement → test.
**Review**: read-only; state findings before proposing fixes.
**Refactor**: no behaviour changes; tests pass before and after.
**Response style**: Balanced — code with brief explanation. · **Ambiguity**: Ask first — always confirm before acting on ambiguity. · **Tone**: Professional — concise, neutral, precise.

## Memory

Memory provides workspace-specific rules and cached facts; use it when available, not as lifecycle authority.

### Memory MCP server

When hooks are enabled, a `memory` MCP server is available. Each specialist agent's instruction file defines when and how to use it. The pattern used by every agent is:

1. **Conditionally** call `memory_dump(agent="<agent-name>", task_hint="<one-sentence task description>")` at the start of each task **when the task involves workspace-specific work** (commands, file edits, paths, tool versions, conventions). Skip the dump for trivial, purely-conversational, or read-only informational tasks that require no workspace context.
2. If `summary.has_data` is `false`, skip memory-dependent steps — memory is empty for this agent.
3. Follow all returned **rules** unconditionally for the rest of the task.
4. Use `fact.age_hours`, `fact.is_fresh`, and `fact.is_stale` to assess fact freshness directly — no separate `elapsed()` call is needed for basic freshness checks. Call `elapsed()` only when precise age in seconds matters.
5. When you discover workspace-specific facts, call `memory_set(agent="<agent-name>", key=..., value=..., retention=...)` before finishing. Use `retention="short_term"` for task-scoped discoveries (auto-expires in 8 h); use `retention="long_term"` for durable project facts (language, build system, conventions).
6. If the `memory` server is unavailable, emit one visible note ("⚠️ Memory MCP unavailable: [reason]") then continue without it.

## Skills and Agents

See `## Agent Routing` for the authoritative routing table; this section is a quick-reference index.

### Skills

- `lifecycleAudit` — loaded on demand; run before any lifecycle operation
- `agenticReview` — loaded on demand; evaluate or improve Copilot surface files
- `ciPreflight` — loaded on demand; run CI-equivalent checks before push
- `testing` — loaded on demand; run targeted or full tests through workspace-declared test apparatus

### Agents

- `cleaner` — prune stale artefacts, caches, archives, and dead files
- `commit` — git operations, commit messages, staging, push, pull, PR work
- `debugger` — diagnose failures and isolate root causes before implementation
- `deps` — scan dependencies, audit packages, check for vulnerabilities, install/update/repair/remove
- `docs` — write and update documentation, migration guides, and technical walkthroughs
- `explore` — broad read-only codebase exploration and architecture lookup
- `organise` — move files, regroup folders, fix broken paths (subagent-only)
- `planner` — produce scoped execution plans for multi-step work before implementation
- `researcher` — gather source-backed external constraints before implementation or review
- `review` — code, architecture, security, correctness, and regression-risk review; handles codebase audits
- `triage` — first-pass complexity assessment; classify and route before acting (subagent-only)
- `xanadLifecycle` — handles all `setup`, `inspect`, `interview`, `health-check`, `health-report`, `plan`, `update`, `repair`, `factory-restore`, and **health check** requests
